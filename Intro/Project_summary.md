### **📌 Project: AI-Powered Client-Side Food Ordering Assistant**  

#### **🔹 Project Overview**  
We are developing an **AI-driven client-side food ordering assistant** that **learns user behavior, optimizes interactions, and makes intelligent recommendations**. The system will function **entirely in the browser**, leveraging **machine learning, reinforcement learning, and client-side storage** to personalize the user experience.  

#### **🔹 Core Features & Goals**  
1️⃣ **User Interaction Tracking** – Capture user choices (e.g., food selections, preferences) for AI learning.  
2️⃣ **Client-Side AI Agent** – Use lightweight **machine learning models** to **predict and recommend user selections** in real time.  
3️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning** – Adjust recommendations based on user feedback and historical behavior.  
4️⃣ **Local Storage & Personalization** – Utilize **IndexedDB** or **localStorage** to save user preferences for personalization.  
5️⃣ **Web Workers for Performance** – Ensure AI computations don’t impact UI responsiveness.  

#### **🔹 Technical Approach**  
- **Frameworks**: Brain.js (for lightweight neural networks), rl-js (for reinforcement learning).  
- **Learning Strategy**: Semi-supervised learning, combining predefined rules with user-driven adaptations.  
- **Architecture**: Client-side AI first, with a potential hybrid model (server-based model updates in the future).  
- **UI Enhancements**: Improved dropdown interactions, personalized UI suggestions, and real-time adjustments.  

#### **🔹 Current Progress & Next Steps**  
✅ Designed the UI with **dropdown-based selections** for food ordering.  
✅ Implemented **multi-selection dropdowns** for sauces.  
🔜 Next step: **Integrating AI for real-time suggestions based on past user behavior**.  



 The "Cold Start" Problem – What Happens When a User Has No Data?
You're asking the most important question in AI-driven recommendations:
👉 How does Brain.js provide a "smart" starting point when a user has no past data?

This is called the "Cold Start Problem"—when a system has zero historical data for a new user.
