Let me give you a detailed description of our code flow so far:

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. UI (HTML/CSS)
- We have a single-page design with two distinct sections:
  - Top section: Card-based main dish selection (burger, pizza, salad, pasta)
  - Bottom section: AI recommendations that appear after selecting a main dish
- Current UI uses placeholder values for demonstration

### 2. IndexedDB Structure (db.js)
- We've created a database structure with three object stores:
  - `orders`: Stores order history for later training
  - `aiModels`: Stores trained AI models and initialization status
  - `config`: Stores system configuration (training frequency, counters)
- Key functions for data persistence:
  - `openDatabase()`: Creates/opens the database
  - `saveOrder()`: Records orders and updates counters
  - `saveAIModel()`: Saves AI models (Brain.js and rl-js)
  - `loadAIModel()`: Retrieves saved models
  - `updateOrderCounter()`: Tracks orders since last training

### 3. Brain.js Neural Network (brain-network.js)
- Created a `FoodRecommender` class that:
  - Initializes a neural network with Brain.js
  - Checks if this is first-time initialization via `initialization-status` in IndexedDB
  - Performs initial training with normalized probability data if needed
  - Loads existing model if available
  - Can predict recommendations based on main dish selection
  - Can retrain using order history when enough data is collected

### 4. Execution Flow on Page Load
a. Page loads with UI showing main dish options
b. IndexedDB is initialized
c. Brain.js neural network is loaded:
   - System checks if initialization has occurred before (via `initialization-status` in IndexedDB)
   - If first time: Performs initial training with default data, then marks as initialized
   - If not first time: Loads existing model from IndexedDB
d. When user selects a main dish, the recommendation section appears
   - Currently showing hardcoded values, will be replaced with actual AI predictions

### What We've Implemented
- ✅ UI structure with separate sections
- ✅ IndexedDB foundation for data persistence
- ✅ Brain.js neural network with initial training
- ✅ Logic to ensure training occurs only once

### What's Still Needed
- rl-js implementation for reinforcement learning
- Connection between UI and AI components
- Order processing logic
- Debug panel to show AI decision process

Does this accurately reflect your understanding of where we are in the implementation process?
